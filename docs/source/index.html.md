# Introduction

Welcome to XJS Framework API Reference! XJS Framework allows you to create XSplit Broadcaster plugins
using web technologies, with JavaScript as the language to communicate with XSplit Broadcaster's core
functionalities. This allows you to leverage the web to create visually stunning user interfaces, while
still being able to call native functionalities of XSplit Broadcaster.

This documentation is organized in a way that the center column contains most of the details, while the
dark right column would contain some code examples.

# Xjs Class

## Constructor

> Creating an Xjs instance:

```javascript
import Xjs from 'xjs-framework';

const xjs = new Xjs();
```

> You can also pass in a configuration:

```javascript
import Xjs from 'xjs-framework';

const xjs = new Xjs({
  type: 'remote',
  sendMessage: message => dummyConnection.send(message),
});
```

> You can have multiple xjs instances:

```javascript
import Xjs from 'xjs-framework';

const xjs = new Xjs();
const remoteXjs = new Xjs({
  type: 'remote',
  sendMessage: message => dummyConnection.send(message),
});
```

You need to create an Xjs instance first to get anything done. It is possible to create multiple Xjs instances, and you can configure an Xjs instance by passing a config object.
